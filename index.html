      This safety equipment will assist the user by delivering important information to the mobile phones of their family members through SMS as well as to a dedicated server that can be accessed remotely by the server whenever the person wearing the device feels unsecured or uncomfortable. This gadget has features that the user will find to be quite helpful. Our safety equipment has the ability to gauge the user's heart rate and oxygen saturation. The device will send the user's location, photos of the immediate area, and a link that can be used to view live footage of the user's surroundings by a spy camera, if the heart rate value exceeds the threshold value (120 bpm) when the user is being threatened by someone. The family members will receive this information at the same time as information will be sent to the sever
Additionally, this device has a few extra features that increase its reliability and security. This gadget can share information without an internet connection and is capable to store pictures and videos of the user's surroundings on an SD card that is inserted inside the gadget. Later, that video can be utilised as legal proof to support the accident situation for the victim. This gadget also features a takeoff sensor, which is highly helpful in cases where the gadget unintentionally falls off the user's wrist or is stolen. In that situation, it will also communicate with the server.
